# EstrellaCampaign
We want to amplify the brand's most recent initiative to eliminate plastic rings from its packaging, by establishing a connection between the affected marine endangered species, and our users.
# Experience
As our users scan their can with their phones, they'll engage with an augmented reality displaying their can surrounded by sea water and plastic waste floating around it.
As the users move the plastic waste away, a call to action will redirect them to this landing page.

On the landing page, the users meet an endangered marine animal, who has an important message to deliver to them.
Each user  will meet a different marine species, which will be randomly assigned to them as they reach our landing page.

As the users scroll down, we invite them to design our new limited edition packaging.
The users who have previous experience with design tools can download our Photoshop template, and those who aren't familiar with design tools can just download our printable template.

The users will create their designs using the endangered animal they met before as their inspiration.
